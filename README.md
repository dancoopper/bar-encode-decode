# bar-encode-decode
## the idea is not mine but the execution is 100% mine
#### the idea behind this way of encoding was that you can do this and then give someone to numbers that when you use an equation you get the encoded text
#### so if I wanted to do the word "cat" that would be 003001020 or .003001020 but insted of giving you that number I would give you numbers A and B and you would have to do something like divide the two together and then decode that number
